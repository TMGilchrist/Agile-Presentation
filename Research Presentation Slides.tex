\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Criticism of Agile}
	
	Scalability is a common Criticism of the Agile methodology. 
	
	\vspace{5mm}
	
	Two Primary Scaling issues:	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Large scope, complex projects
		\item Large development teams
	\end{enumerate}	
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Complex projects}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Requirement changes
		\item Lack of precise initial designs
		\item Mixing of Agile and Non-Agile teams
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
	
	
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Large Teams}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item As teams grow larger, communication becomes more difficult
		\item Lack of disciplined self-organisation
		\item Scrum meetings become increasingly impractical
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Possible Solutions}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Scrum of Scrums	
		\item Lean Governance
		\item Multiple Backlogs
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Scrum of Scrums}
	
	One of the most common solutions for implementing the Agile methodology in larger groups.
			
	\vspace{5mm}		
			
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Development divided among agile teams, each team has an dedicated Ambassador
		\item The ambassadors from each team convene their own Scrum, communicating the progress of their own teams and discussing issues
	\end{enumerate}
	
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Lean Development Governance}
	
	A framework for governing lean software development, created by Scott Ambler and Per Kroll of IBM.
	
	\vspace{5mm}
	
	Core principles of Lean Governance that can increase success when scaling agile development:		
	
	\vspace{3mm}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Risk-Based Milestones - Choosing high-value features to develop each sprint while aiming to reduce risk involved
		\item Align Team Structure with Architecture - Team structure will heavily influence program structure
		\item Staged Program Delivery - Each project in a program should choose their release dates and either meet them or skip them
	\end{enumerate}


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Multiple Backlogs}
	
	A solution used by Nokia, utilising four levels of backlogs, along with a Scrum of Scrums.
	
	\vspace{5mm}
	
	Program Level:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Program Content Backlog - Top Level Requirements
		\item Program Backlogs - User stories for each release of the program
	\end{enumerate}

	\vspace{3mm}

	Team Level:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Scrum Team Backlogs - User stories for each individual team
		\item Sprint Backlogs - The tasks for each sprint
	\end{enumerate}

	\vspace{5mm}

	Relied on experienced managers to maintain long-term vision and ensure team cohesion.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Remaining Issues}
	
	Many scalability concerns that are not necessarily addressed by these suggestions.
	
	\vspace{5mm}
	
	In practice, some compromises may have to be made:	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Lower expectations for change
		\item Create basic architecture frameworks to provide a base to work off
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
